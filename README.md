In this problem you can run the python file to give you "pokemon_emerald.pcap"

Then using the lua script provided you add it to wireshark as a plugin and you can see the new "game actions" of what happened in game


If the python file doesn't run we can just provide the pcap file, ideally though they use the lua script.
